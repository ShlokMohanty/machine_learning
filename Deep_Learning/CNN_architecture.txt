0=> 0 64=>1 128=>2
48=>3 192=>4 144=>5
142=>6 226=>7 168=>8

-1=>0 0=>1 2=>2
0.5=>3 4.5=>4 -1.5=>5
1.5=>6 2=>7 -3=>8

current pixel value is 192
consider the  neighbor values 
filter definition: 
current pixel value = 192
new pixel value = (-1*0) + (0*64) + (-2*128) + 
(0.5*48) + (4.5*192) + (-1.5*144) +
(1.5*42) + (2*226) + (-3*168)

but imagine a very clear picture showing everything including the background and the images to focus on
but if we multiply it with the kernel having values as 

-1=>0 0=>1 1=>2 
-2=>3 0=>4 2=>5 
-1=>6 0=>7 1=>8
 when mulltiplied with the kernel matrix removes everything except the vertical lines.
 
-1=>0 -2=>1 -1=>2 
0=>3 0=>4 0=>5 
-1=>6 2=>7 1=>8
 when multiplied with the matrix removes almost everything except the horizontal line.
 
 which can then be combined which is something known as the pooling 
 which groups up the pixels in the image and filters them down to a subset
 
 0 64           128 128
 48 192 : 192   144 144 : 144
 
 142 226         168 0
 255 0 : 255      0 64 : 168 

192 144
255 168
the image will be reduced to a quarter of its original size but the features can still be maintaied 
after beung filtered and maxpooled 
the image size becomes one quarter of the original image size 
 maxpooling in the sets of 2x2 will group the image into sets of 2x2 pixels 
 and it picks the largest from each set .
 where does these filters come from ?
 when the image is passed as the input to the convolutional neural network a number of randomly 
 initialized filters will pass over the image.
 the results are then passed onto the next layer and matching is performed by the neural network.
 overtime the filters that give us the image outputs that gives the best matches will be learned 
 and the process is called the feature extraction.
 
 example: how a convolution filter layer helps the computer visualize the things.
 we can see across the top row that we actually have a shoe which has been filtered down to the sole 
 and the silhouette of a shoe by making the filters learn what a shoe looks like.
