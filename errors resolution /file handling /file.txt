Try-1 : 

from pathlib import Path 
p = Path('D://Model')
print(p.exists()) #to check if the folder already has been uploaded for confirmation 
print(p.is_file())
print(p.read_text())

with p.open() as f:
  f.read_line()

alernatively, prefixing the string with r disables escaping allowing direct pasting of the path 
p = Path(r'D://Model')
