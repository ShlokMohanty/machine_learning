Symmetric:

1) mean , median , mode are all the same here 
2) no skewness is apparent 
3) the distribution is described as symmetric 

Left skewed or skewed left :

1) mean < median 
2) long tail on the left 

Right-skewed or skewed right :

1) mean > median 
2) long tail on the right 

considerations for choosing a measure of central tendency :
1) for a nominal variable the mode is only measure that can be used .
2) For ordinal variables, the mode and the median may be used.The median provides more information 
(taking into account the ranking of categories)

3) For interval-ratio variables , the mode, median and the mean may all be calculated .
Mean provides the most information about the distribution , but the median is preferred if the distribution is skewed .

Level of Measurement ----> 
1) Nominal -------------------> Mode
2) Ordinal ----------> Research Objective ------> Mode, Median 
3) Interval-Ratio -----> Shape of Distribution ----> skewed, symmetrical --> skewed---> Research Objective---> Mode, Median Symmetrical--> Research Objective ---> Mode, Median, Mean
