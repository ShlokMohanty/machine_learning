digital signal processing --> sequence of numbers that represent samples of a continuous variable 
domain such as time, space, or frequency
digital signal is represented as a pulse train 
 DSP applications include audio and speech processing, sonar, radar and other sensor array processing, spectral density estimation, statistical signal processing, digital image processing, data compression, video coding, audio coding, 
 image compression, signal processing for telecommunications, control systems, biomedical engineering, and seismology, among others.
 application of digital computation to signal processing allows for many advantages over analog processing in many applications, such as error detection and correction in transmission as well as data compression.[5] Digital signal processing is also fundamental to digital technology, 
 such as digital telecommunication and wireless communications.[6] DSP is applicable to both streaming data and static (stored) data.
 The surrounding samples may be identified with respect to time or space. The output of a linear digital filter to any given input may be calculated by convolving the input signal with an impulse response.
 fourier transform helps convert the time and space domain to the frequency domain.
 Fourier transform is converted to the power spectrum, which is the magnitude of each frequency component squared.
