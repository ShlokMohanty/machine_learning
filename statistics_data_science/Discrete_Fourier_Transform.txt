Window Function:

In signal processing and statistics, a window function (also known as an apodization function or tapering function[1]) 
is a mathematical function that is zero-valued outside of some chosen interval, normally symmetric around the middle of the interval,
usually near a maximum in the middle, and usually tapering away from the middle. 
Mathematically, when another function or waveform/data-sequence is "multiplied" by a window function, the product is 
also zero-valued outside the interval: all that is left is the part where they overlap, the "view through the window".
Equivalently, and in actual practice, the segment of data within the window is first isolated, and then only that data
is multiplied by the window function values. Thus, tapering, not segmentation, is the main purpose of window functions.
