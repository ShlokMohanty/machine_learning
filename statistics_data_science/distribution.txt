1) Numbers that describe what is the average or the type of distribution a certain data set represents.
2) It may also be called as center or location of the distribution .
3) tendency of quantitative data to cluster around some central value.
4) measure of central tendency is an important aspect of quantitative data .
5) estimate of a typical value .

why need to measure of central tendency ?

purpose of measures of central tendency is :
1) To identify the location of the center of various distributions .
2) Measure of central tendency gives us one value of the distribution and the value represents the entire 
distribution.
3) To condense data sets.
4) to make comparisons:
  1) to compare 2 or more distributions 
5) Helpful in further statistical analysis :
  1) Statistical Analysis techniques such as Measure of dispersion, Measure of skewness, 
  Measure of correlation , etc, use measure of central tendency.
  
Calculate the measure central tendency :
1) The mean 
2) the median 
3) the mode 

mean --> the average of the data .
median --> teh score that divides the distribution into :
  1) Two equal parts 
  2) So half the cases are above it and half below it .
median is the middle score , or average of middle scores in a distribution.

Odd number of Observations :
formula : Median = {(n+1)/2}th term

Even :
Median = [(n/2)th term + {(n/2)+1}th]/2

Mode --> category or score with the largest frequency in the distribution .
mode can be calculated for variables with the levels of measurement that are :
1) nominal
2) Ordinal 
3) interval-ratio

Mode : An Example 
Number of Votes for candidates for Mayor .

Candidate A ---> 11769 votes 
Candidate B----> 39443 votes
Candidate C----> 78331 Votes

Mode--> Candidate C
