Types of variables :
1) in case ofn two variables:
  1) predictor variable could be used to explain the other (dependent variable)
  2) One variable could be though of as causing the other variable to change.
  
 A response variable measures an outcome of a study(think y-value or dependent variable)
 An exploratory variable explains or influences changes in a response variable(think x-value or independent variable)
 
sometimes it is not clear with that which one is the explanatory variable and which is the response variable.

Sometimes teh two variables are related without either being explanatory or response variable.

lurking variable --> not collected including the study

most useful graph to show the relationship between 2 quantitative variable is teh scaater diagram.

If a distinction exists in the two variables being studied ,plot the explanatory variable on teh horizontal scale , and plot 
the response variable on the vertical scale .

with teh help of scatterplot , each individual in the dataset is represented by a single point(x,y)
in the x,y plane 

2 variables have a relationship (linear ) in a scatter plot tend to fall along a more or less straight line .

2 variables have a positive association if above-average values of one variable tend to accompany above average 
values of teh other variables , and below average values tend to occur together.
