One shortcoming of the mean is that means are easily affected by extreme values .
Measures that are not affected by extreme values are called resistant.
Measures that are  affected by extreme values are called as sensitive.
The medians of tyhe two sets are not different . Therefore the median is not that affected by the 
extreme value 9.

The mean is a sensitive measure(or sensitive statistic) and the median is a resistant measure(or resistant statistic).

Adding and multiplying constants:
1) Adding a constant to each element in a data set will increase the mean by that constant .
2) Multiplying a constant to each element in a dataset will increase the factor of that constant.


Looking Ahead :
why de we want to know this ?

ans: in applied statistics such as regression , ANOVA  we work with the concept of transforming 
data.

For many applied statistics methods, a required assumption is that the data is normal, a very 
near bell-shaped .

when the data is not normal, statisticians will transform the data using numerous techniques .
