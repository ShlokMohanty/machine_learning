Measure of Spread:

1) Purpose of identifying central value from a dataset is :
  1) to describe a typical or central value in the dataset .
  
Measure of Spread :
1) With measure of spread out main focus is around :
  1) To calculate how "spread out" our dataset is.

There are three measures of spread :
1) Range 
2) Variance 
3) Standard Deviation

Range :
Range of a variable is simply:
  1) distance between teh largest and the smallest value.
  
  Range = Largest Data Value - Smallest Data Value
  
  if largest/ smallest value change then the range also changes .
  this means taht range is sensitive to outliers .
  
  Variance :

The Variance of a dataset is a numerical summary that 
1) indicates the average deviation of each data value from the mean of teh dataset.

The calculation of variance requires us to :
  1) Copare each data value from our raw dataset to the mean .
  
 The idea of variance is :
just the difference of values from the dataset from teh mean .
