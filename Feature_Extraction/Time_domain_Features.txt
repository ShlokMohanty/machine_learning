#Types of feature extractions 
#1) Time Domain Features 
#2) Frequency domain features 
#3) Spectrum Related features 

#WaveForm Visualization 
#amplitude of the sound vs the time 
#libraries required : matplotlib , librosa 
#

#Spectrogram 
#visual representation of the spectrum of frequencies of a signal as it varies with time 

#time-frequency portraits of signals 
#how energy levels vary with time .
#visual way to represent the signal strength or loudness of a signal over time at various frequencies
#spectgrogram depicted as a heatmap 
#as an image with teh intensity shown by varying the color or brightness.
#stft() --> converts data into short term fourier transform 

#STFT --> we can determine the amplitude of various frequencies playing at a given time of an audio signal

#Fourier-related transform for determination of the sinusoidal frequency and phase content of the
#local sections of a signal as it changes over time.

#method is to divide a longer time signal into shorter segments of equal length and then compute
#the fourier transform separately on each shorter segments 
#one then plots the changing spectrum as a function of time known as a spectrogram 
#linear freq axis can be converted into the logarithmic axis 
#RMSE --> Root mean squared error 
#energy of the signal corresponds to its total magnitude 
#For audio signals this roughly characterizes how loud the signal is (avg of the squares of magnitude of teh audio frames)
#spectrogram gives us more accurate representation of energy
#Reason ----> frames can be windowed 
#MEL Spectrogram-->freq are converted to the mel scale. 

#MEL SCALE: perceptual scale of pitches judged by listeners to be equal in distance from oe another.
#unit of pitch was introduced such that equal distances in pitch sounded equally distant to the 

#Zero Crossing Rate 
#rate at which the signal changes its sign 
#to determine whether a speech frame is voice, unvoiced or silent
#Separation of Harmonic and Percussive Signals 
#broadly classified into two classes 
#Harmonic sound on the one hand side is what we perceive as pitched sound and what makes us hear melodies and chords
#Percussive sound on the other hand is noise-like and usually seems from instrument onsets like the hit
#on a drum or from consonants in speech .
#hpss is harmonic-percussive source separation algorithm.
