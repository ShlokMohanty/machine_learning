searches for relationships among variables.
To answer whether and how some phenomenon influences the other on how several variables are related.
It is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent variable with a given set of independent variable.

Simple Linear Regression:
1)Approach for predicting a response using a single feature.
2)Equation of regression line:
Y = b0 + b1*X + e
where Y-> dependent variable 
      b0-> intercept on Y
      b1-> regression coefficient
      X-> independent variable
      e--->some kind of error 
      
Types of Linear Regressions:
1) simple Linear Regression: If a single independent variable is used to depict the value of a numerical dependent variable then it is called as Simple Linear Regression.
2) Multiple Linear Regression: If more than one independent variable is used to predict the value of the numerical dependent variable then it is known as Multiple 
Linear Regression.
